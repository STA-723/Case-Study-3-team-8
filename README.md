# Case Study 3: The College Alcohol Study ICPSR 4291

**Summary:**

The Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study (CAS), a multi-round survey that interviewed students in four-year colleges, examined key issues in alcohol abuse and other high risk behaviors among college students, including the relationship of state alcohol control measures and college policies to alcohol use and the role of fraternities and sororities, easy access to alcohol, and low alcohol prices. As in the previous rounds of CAS, which were conducted in 1993 (ICPSR 6577), 1997 (ICPSR 3163), and 1999 (ICPSR 3818), this round collected information on students' use of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, views on campus alcohol policies and student alcohol use, reasons for drinking alcohol and reasons for not drinking or limiting drinking, and personal difficulties caused by drinking problems (e.g., missed classes and trouble with police). Additional topics covered by the survey include overall health status, daily activities, satisfaction with education being received, grade-point average, living arrangements, social life, sexual activity (heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual), use of condoms during sexual intercourse, rape, and drunk driving. Background variables include age, height, weight, sex, marital status, religion, mother's and father's education, mother's and father's drinking habits, race, and Hispanic origin.

**Goal:**

Develop a predictive model of student alcohol consumption and associated risks in order to help schools allocate help and support as effectively as possible.

**Challenges and considerations:**

- Non-representative sample (try post-stratification?)
- Missing values
